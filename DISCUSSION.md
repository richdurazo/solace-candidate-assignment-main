# Solace Engineering Assignment - Discussion & Improvements

**Repository:** [GitHub Repo Link](https://github.com/richdurazo/solace-candidate-assignment-main)

## ðŸš€ If I Had More Time 
### (depending on the project requirements) some performance improvements i'd consider adding:

### Testing 
- **Unit Tests** - If I had more time i'd add unit tests. Perhaps 80-90% code coverage depending on requirements 

### Frontend Enhancements
- **Pagination** - Implement server-side pagination to handle large datasets efficiently
- **Virtual Scrolling** - For tables with hundreds of thousands of advocates, implement virtual scrolling to only render visible rows
- **Advanced Filtering** - Add filters by city, degree, experience range, and specialties, other table features depending on requirements and users needs
- **Sorting** - Add column sorting with visual indicators
- **Export Functionality** - Allow users to export filtered results to CSV/PDF (if needed)
- **Responsive Design** - Improve mobile experience with collapsible columns and touch-friendly interactions, I started trying to implement a bit of Solaces design but didn't want to take to long given the time constraint 
- **Oranization** - I focused more on functionality and getting a quick apealing UI up, So if i had more time i'd have a more organized project structure. 


### Backend Performance Optimizations - (depending on requirements and users experience needs)
- **Database Indexing** - Add indexes on frequently searched columns (firstName, lastName, city, specialties)
- **Full-Text Search** - Implement PostgreSQL full-text search for better search performance across large datasets
- **Caching Layer** - Add caching for frequently accessed data and search results
- **Query Optimization** - Implement query pagination, limit result sets, and optimize JOIN operations
- **Search Analytics** - Track popular searches to optimize database queries and caching strategies

## ðŸš¨ Critical Bugs & Anti-Patterns (Priority - 1)
### Frontend Issues
- [x] **Bug Accessibility violation** - Missing `<tr>` wrapper in table headers
- [x] **Search Functionality Broken** - yearsOfExperience bug and add phone numbers, Fixed specialties search
- [x] **Direct DOM Manipulation** - Replace `document.getElementById().innerHTML` with React state
- [x] **No Error Handling** - API calls lack try/catch blocks and user feedback
- [x] **TypeScript Types Missing** - Add proper interfaces for Advocate data and event handlers
- [X] **XSS Vulnerability** - Direct innerHTML usage without sanitization

### Backend Issues
- [x] **Missing Error Handling** - API routes don't handle database connection failures
- [x] **Type Safety** - Proper database operation types fixes build issues, type-safe API responses
- [x] **Database Integration** - Implemented PostgreSQL database with Docker
- [x] **Performance Monitoring** - Added response time tracking and logging
- [x] **Database Scripts** - Fixed missing seed script and migration setup issues

### ðŸ”’ Security Issues

- [x] **Environment Variables** - `.env` files not properly ignored (FIXED)
- [x] **Database Security** - Proper connection handling and error sanitization
- [x] **API Security** - No internal error leakage to clients

## ðŸŽ¨ UX/UI Improvements (Priority 2)

### User Experience
- [x] **Poor Visual Design** - Basic styling, no modern UI components
- [x] **No Responsive Design** - Table breaks on mobile devices
- [x] **No Empty States** - No feedback when no results found
- [x] **No Loading Indicators** - Users don't know when data is loading


## âš¡ Performance Issues (Priority 3)
- [x] **No Debouncing** - Search triggers on every keystroke, causing excessive re-renders
- [x] **No Loading States** - Users don't know when data is being fetched
- [x] **Database Performance** - Added caching headers and response time monitoring
- [x] **API Performance** - Implemented proper database connection pooling
